                <h3><i>Schoolwork:</i></h3>
                <p>I did not actually do much schoolwork yesterday - however, I met with my group for this class and we introduced
                ourselves. I got to know that our group is just a bunch of nerds (like me) that love gaming...and more gaming. I don't actually
                know what else I learned about them but we had fun doing...:

            <p>Okay - so: I'm not going to lie here I don't want to describe how mundane my life is so - I'm going to do soemthing else
            instead here and just talk about the food I ate: I had boba, puffcorn, dumplings, fruits, noodles, cereal, and a grilled cheese
            ...not in that order though.

            <h2><Strong>April 8, 2021</Strong></h2>
            <p>...so COVID is going to make this sound even more uninteresting but actually: I'm just going to have a therapy session
            (though not too far cause ion kno you reader) but I'm seriously struggling with motivation, desire to do anything, and actual
            meaning while being stuck inside. Hopefully, I get get my appointment for the vaccine soon cause I'm about to lose it. It does not
            help that my city, while really well off, has nothing going for it so I can't check stuff out in my occasional outings
